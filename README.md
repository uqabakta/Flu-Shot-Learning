Project Name: Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines
Date Published: 08/08/2024
Competition Link: DrivenData Flu Shot Learning

Project Overview:

This project involves several steps to predict H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine uptake:

Loading and Understanding the Data
Feature Selection
Data Imputation
Model Fitting and Prediction
The folders included in this repository contain the files and data related to each step.

Note: If you are interested in improving the prediction score, you can experiment with the ANN model provided. 
The current model gives reasonable results but is not fully optimized.
